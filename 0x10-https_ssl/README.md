# HTTPS SSL

In this project, I learned how to configure my domain zone and to configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic.
I learned how to use 'awk'.
I completed a basic configuration of my domain and subdomains.
The server is accessible at [22coder.tech](http://22coder.tech).

## Tasks

  * [0-world_wide_web](./0-world_wide_web): Bash script that displays information about a domain and its subdomains.
  * Accepts one mandatory argument, the domain name and one optional argument, the subdomain name
  * It queries DNS server to retrieve the IP address or hostname associated with the domain and its subdomains.
